Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin' from afar, reachin' for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh huh
From one corner to another, uh huh

Some got hopes and dreams, we got ways and mean
The supreme dream team always up with the scheme
From hub caps to sellin' raps, name your theme
